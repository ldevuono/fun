        <p>i sit at my desk and google slurs for $30/hr. For eight hours a day, I mine my brain for new depravities;
            digging in the dirt, i shake up thoughts—my mind faintly abuzz, a
            slipstream river running, sword-shaped twigs on its back and sharp craggy rocks in its belly. “babe, <a
                href="twigs.html">can</a> you
            think of an example of hate speech? no, i’ve already done that one to death.”
            the air outside smells of lox, stepping outside i’m swimming through vinegar and smoke.
