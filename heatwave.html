        <p> there’s a blood stain on the sidewalk outside my house. i can see it from my kitchen window. when the sun
            beats in at 11am, it shines an unnatural crimson onto the linoleum. at first it was sticky, wet
            wine-coloured, glistening, glossy in its thick near-black. flies hovered around, dipping their toes in. i
            wanted to join them, to stick my tongue in the pool, but instead i walked past it, turned around and walked
            past it again. i found a plastic container full of iridescent glass pebbles on my walk yesterday. i put them
            into a shallow blue and purple dish i found abandoned weeks before. the tumbling, shifting sound they made
            as i washed them, transferring them from container to sieve to towel to dish, woke the cat. all my walks
            lately have felt weighed down, like my limbs are too heavy, every step a slog. when i get home i immediately
            want to leave again. when the sun’s about to set i’ll head out for another walk, down the street, up the
            alley, to the old gas station on the hill and back. when i get home it’ll be dark. i’ll sidestep around the
            stain, shimmering in the uncanny heat. i’ll move my hand through the dish of cool glass beads and imagine
            relief.
