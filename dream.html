        <p>robert altman dreamt three women. salesforce was conceived in a dream. i’m sitting in front of my computer
            while the world beyond my window watches me. i crave sorrow, feeling, i want to touch a mossy tree, i want
            to jump in the ocean, i want to live a bigger life than this. lately i’ve been dreaming that i’m walking
            around carrying my cat in my arms. i clutch him, armfuls of fur and squirming muscle. we have somewhere to
            be. i walk down to the water, see the ice floating in pieces, a bobbing jigsaw.
        </p>
        <p>
            for a brief window of time last summer, i felt a new peace, wide open space, my mind quiet and sparse, a
            vast meadow, warm breeze. i’m back to being congested, contracted, my brain is opaque and tight and i can’t
            form a sentence. i know what i’m doing to myself but i continue to do it. i’ve always poked prodded and
            squeezed marks on my face, picked my cuticles to bleeding and throbbing, dreamt of stuffing my face with
            pastries, done anything but work when a deadline was fast approaching. these things are all connected. ive
            been feeling the itch lately, to create something, to make connections, writing things down, photographing
            light, drawing similarities, but when it comes to doing the damn thing, my mind is a stone, impenetrable,
            shut tight.
        </p>
        <p>
            i want to dance, i want to sing, i want to scream, to feel damp earth, sun on my skin, read a
            book in
            the grass. why is my lot in life to stare at a screen 8 hours a day. i agonize over my Linkedin.com profile,
            cementing myself as a software expert. I wonder if any of my potential employers know that Salesforce was
            conceived in a dream.
        </p>
        <p>
            i need to dunk my head in ice water. how does one <a href="grid.html">start again?</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            i go for a walk to shake up my thoughts but as soon as i walk back in the door, they settle back into sand.
            is it home that’s stifling? too dark, too stuffed, dust filling the spaces in my mind where thoughts ought
            to be? do i seek comfort or chaos? the great stagnation is deep seated. i feel it in my heavy limbs, my
            groggy mind. my life feels empty, meaningless. i imagine this is why people have children—to fill this
            void—but the thought does not soothe me. would i want to be a mother if my circumstances were different? if
            i lived somewhere i loved and filled my days with purpose and pleasure? or would i feel the same
            restlessness? i don’t have friends. no one to hold my child and love it just because it came from me. i
            don’t want to be a mother. i want to be the child. to be unburdened, to look wide-eyed at a bird, a tree. is
            having children the only way to feel fulfilled, even if i don’t want them? was i programmed this way? i
            fight against nature.
