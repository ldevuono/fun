            I walk home drenched in sweat, talking to my mom about swimming. No one in my family likes the beach, except
            for me. How can she see a lake and not long to enter it? “You’ve always been that way,” she says.

            I stop at the bookstore across from the park, joke with the clerk, “the air’s so heavy out there it feels
            like you’re swimming.” i grab a book at random, wrapped in cellophane, something to read while i wait for my
            haircut. I wade through the heat to a cafe, tear open the plastic and read opening lines about swimming in a
            lake at dawn, the “bolt of pure aliveness” upon entering the water.

            I leave the air conditioned salon and step back out into the thick evening; thunder grumbles in the
            distance. Halfway through the short journey home, the sky opens up. There’s no saving the haircut, so i
            submit, my face streaming with water, dress soaked through. I look up at the sky and feel that bolt,
            fragrant lindens dripping, sun bursting through a wall of rain.
