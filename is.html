    <p>
        i’ve been &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; time finding &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;. and lately has
        felt like a
        long &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        get stuck at
        the &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of my skull; just &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of reach they &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; heavy, lodged
        in the back of my &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;. i’m shaking
        my &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; wet dog to dislodge them, but i’m only &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with a throbbing, &nbsp;
        &nbsp; &nbsp; ache.
        i’m
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        thoughts of &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a hammer to the whole &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;, prying the plates open &nbsp;
        &nbsp; &nbsp; the back of it before smashing &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        flat &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; jagged marrowed &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;. i imagine this kind of violence a lot. &nbsp;
        &nbsp; &nbsp;
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        burst &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my
        weak, trembling &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;, to forget&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; jumbled head and &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; only
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; body.
        i want to
        feel &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; crush under &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;weight. a two-way mirror
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a one-way
        mirror. i
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        behind the glass. the first &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; i had this thought, it felt &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; clouds
        opening, light pouring through.
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; i type&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; throbs above me and i feel &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;. i don’t know
        how to write a
        sentence &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;myself in it. the cat digs &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        and i sweep up the
        dust. i’m
        standing &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        her house and <a href="my-world.html">looking</a> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she doesn’t see me, and how &nbsp; &nbsp;
        &nbsp; a
        two-way mirror only works one
        way. her &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fuchsia and i &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her. i &nbsp; &nbsp;
        &nbsp; there &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lights
        turn off &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to
        bed. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sits in the front &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with her &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;. for as
        long as i can
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;, when &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in a car, i &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her like this. &nbsp;
        &nbsp; &nbsp;
        if you sit like that, &nbsp;
        &nbsp; &nbsp; were the car to crash,
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; get folded in half, legs violently &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;, knees piercing your eyeballs. but
        would this not happen anyway,
        were the &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to crash? at least &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she can feel &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sun
        on her toes.
