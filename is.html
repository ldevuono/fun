    <p>
        i’ve been having a hard time finding my words lately. and lately has felt like a long time. they get stuck at
        the base of my skull; just out of reach they sit heavy, lodged in the back of my throat. i’m constantly shaking
        my head like a wet dog to dislodge them, but i’m only left with a throbbing, dull ache. i’m plagued with
        thoughts of taking a hammer to the whole mess, prying the plates open with the back of it before smashing them
        flat into jagged marrowed pieces. i imagine this kind of violence a lot. i want to feel power burst from my
        weak, trembling fingers, to forget about my jumbled head and experience only the movement of my body. i want to
        feel something crush under my meagre weight. a two-way mirror is also called a one-way mirror. i watch the world
        from behind the glass. the first time i had this thought, it felt like clouds opening, light pouring through.
        now i type this as my house throbs above me and i feel nothing. i don’t know how to write a sentence without
        involving myself in it. the cat digs feverishly in the litter box and i sweep up the dust. i’m standing outside
        her house and <a href="my-world.html">looking</a> through the window. she doesn’t see me, and how could she? a
        two-way mirror only works one
        way. her living room glows fuchsia and i know her. i stand there until her lights turn off and she stumbles to
        bed. my mom sits in the front seat with her bare feet up on the dashboard. for as long as i can remember, when i
        think of my mom in a car, i picture her like this. i read once that if you sit like that, were the car to crash,
        you’d get folded in half, legs violently broken, knees piercing your eyeballs. but would this not happen anyway,
        were the car to crash? at least this way she can feel the sun on her toes.
