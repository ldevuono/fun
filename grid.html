        <p>i <a href="rumbling.html">dreamt</a> that i was back at my place. i was away for a weekend and came back to a
            couple using
            my apartment
            as a set for a folkore themed roleplay/altar, using my bed and all my stuff and the rest of the house
            was filled with dog shit and cal didn't want me to move in with him. the walls were flimsy. looking over the
            half wall into my apartment filled with girls in flowy dresses and flower crowns chanting, <a
                href="aglow.html">golden light.</a> we
            breathed out tiny red particles. someone smashed the wall down on the other side<a href="willow.html">.</a>

        <p>another epiphany this morning: sense, memory. different from the image of a two sided mirror and an operating
            room filled with everyone i've ever observed, more true maybe, or <a href="red.html">less</a> true.</p>

            Not bobbing in the ocean at sunrise

            But awoken at five am by a boom of thunder

            The sky aglow Pale light


            bursting through the outlines of the windowshade


            Impossibly bright
