        <p>i dreamt that i was back at my place. i was away for a weekend and came back to a couple using my apartment
            as a place to do a folkore themed roleplay/altar, using my bed and all my stuff and the rest of the house
            was filled with dog shit and cal didn't want me to move in with him. the walls were flimsy. looking over the
            half wall into my apartment filled with girls in flowy dresses and flower crowns chanting, <a
                href="aglow.html">golden light.</a> we
            breathed out tiny red particles. someone smashed the wall down on the other side.</p>

        <p>another epiphany this morning: sense, memory. different from the image of a two sided mirror and an operating
            room filed with everyone i've ever observed, more true maybe, or less true.</p>

        <p>i sit at my desk and google slurs for $30/hr. For eight hours a day, I mine my brain for new depravities;
            digging in the dirt, i shake up thoughts—my mind faintly abuzz, a
            slipstream river running, sword-shaped twigs on its back and sharp craggy rocks in its belly. “babe, can you
            think of an example of hate speech? no, i’ve already done that one to death.”
            the air outside smells of lox, stepping outside i’m swimming through vinegar and smoke.

            Not bobbing in the ocean at sunrise

            But awoken at five am by a boom of thunder

            The sky aglow Pale light


            bursting through the outlines of the windowshade


            Impossibly bright

            I walk home drenched in sweat, talking to my mom about swimming. No one in my family likes the beach, except
            for me. How can she see a lake and not long to enter it? “You’ve always been that way,” she says.

            I stop at the bookstore across from the park, joke with the clerk, “the air’s so heavy out there it feels
            like you’re swimming.” i grab a book at random, wrapped in cellophane, something to read while i wait for my
            haircut. I wade through the heat to a cafe, tear open the plastic and read opening lines about swimming in a
            lake at dawn, the “bolt of pure aliveness” upon entering the water.

            I leave the air conditioned salon and step back out into the thick evening; thunder grumbles in the
            distance. Halfway through the short journey home, the sky opens up. There’s no saving the haircut, so i
            submit, my face streaming with water, dress soaked through. I look up at the sky and feel that bolt,
            fragrant lindens dripping, sun bursting through a wall of rain.
